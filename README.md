# Linear_Regression

In this Model, I built a simple linear regression model to predict the sales based on appropriate predictor variable for a given dataset of advertising.csv

Steps:

1. Understand the data
2. Check the Linear dependent variables
3. Build a model using both sklearn and statsmodels libraries.
4. Evaluate the models 
5. Check the Error terms - for linear regression model assumptions
